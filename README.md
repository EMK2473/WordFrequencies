## Description
The WordFrequencies program counts and displays the frequency of each word in a given string. It starts by reading an integer which represents the size of the input array, followed by a line of text. The program splits the text into words, counts the occurrences of each word, and prints each word along with its frequency. The program ignores case when counting frequencies.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/EMK2473/WordFrequencies.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd WordFrequencies 
```
- Compile the WordFrequencies.java file: 
```Java
- javac WordFrequencies.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java WordFrequencies
```
## Application Usage
Input the size of the array: Enter an integer representing the number of words in the array. Input the line of text: Enter a line of text which contains the words to be analyzed. The program will output each unique word from the input line followed by its frequency in the line.  Example:  

Input: 
```Java
5 apple banana apple orange apple banana  
```
Output:
```Java 
apple 3 
banana 2 
orange 1
```
